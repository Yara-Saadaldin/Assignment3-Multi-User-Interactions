My idea was to create a multiplayer game where users are supposed to compete on who could 
find Pikachu first and also collaborate on collecting pokeballs on their way to finding 
Pikachu.

In terms of interaction, i wanted it to work in the sense that: 
   - When a user collects a pokeball, the pokeball is supposed to disappear from every 
     user's environment and they should get a message that a pokeball has been 
     collected along with the amount of pokeballs left to be collected. 
   - When a user finds Pikachu, they should get feedback telling them that they won and 
     everyone else should get a feedback that they lost. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to get everything to work as I planned. The reason is that 
I found it very difficult to understand sockets and how they work. In fact, I had to 
rewatch lecture 7 several times to grasp the idea and even after all that I wasn't able to
figure out how to make connections. The only connections that I have got to work is letting
the player who finds Pikachu know that they won along with receiving some events on the 
console. Not to mention that this isn't the first idea i came with and implemented, I was 
actually planning to make a table pong game that records the scores of the users and tells
them who won and who lost. I actually spent a whole day and a half trying to create that to 
then end up giving up because I realized that it is too difficult and that I wasn't moving 
too far plus it doesn't even fullfill all the requiremnts. Thank god we were given extra 
time because by the time I came up with this final game idea and started implementing it I
only had 2 days and a half which I used every hour of and barely gotten any sleep from. 
It was going really well in the beggining that I had such high hopes that I thought i'd 
have time to make it work on a mobile device too. Unfortunately when it came to the part 
where I had to implement sockets I got stuck. In fact, I wasted a whole day today and
barely made any progress, If anything i became more lost the more I worked on.

That is when I realized that I overestimated my abilities and aimed too high but it was
already too late, I couldn't think of alternatives and I really wanted this to work. 
With all that being said, I could say one positive thing which is that I really like how
visually appealing the final result came to be. I also really like my idea and am looking
forward on making this fully functional during summer to include in my portfolio. I would
100% want to play this if it was an actual game. But anyways for now I really tried my best
to use all the time that was given and did my best even though I am disappointed.
